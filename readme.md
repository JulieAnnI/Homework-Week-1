Homework Week 1: Code Refractor

Description
This assignment was an "on-the-job ticket" meaning I was provided starter code which I then had to modify to the client's desire They wished to modify their site so the codebase would follow accessibility standards so the site would be optimized for search engines. I also had to clean up repetitive CSS code and make sure all links and images were functioning correctly. 
First, I fixed the link in the header that brought you to the "Search Engine Optimization" section in the main body. This was very simple, I only had to add the missing ID tag in the codebase. 
I then fixed the links for every image by making them relative paths to my images folder I created. I also added alt attributes to all images. This will help bring the site up to accessibility standards and increase SEO. 
I then replaces all the "div" tags in the codebase with semantic HTML elements. This was one of the most important parts to satisfy the client's request. This brings the site to accessibility standards and help Search Engine Optimization. 
I went throught the CSS file and took out access selectors and properties to consildate the codebase. Finally, I added appropriate comments to both the HTML and CSS files to make them easier to understand. 
One challenge I faced in this assignment, is I had a small problem with one of my images. I could not figure out why it was not working. I finally asked the TAs to look at my code. Immediately, they saw the error, one of my backslashes was facing the wrong way in my image link! This small error had stopped the image from functioning. I learned that I have to pay attention to the smallest details in coding, for these can create big problems!
